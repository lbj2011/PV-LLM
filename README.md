# PV-LLM: Leveraging Multimodal LLMs for PV Analysis

PV-LLM is a novel framework that utilizes **multimodal large language models (LLMs)** to perform advanced analysis in photovoltaics (PV), including **degradation assessment** and **health monitoring**. This project demonstrates how AI can accelerate PV system diagnostics and knowledge extraction from global data sources.

## 1. PV Health Monitoring via Multimodal LLMs

Photovoltaic modules experience various types of degradation and faults during operation. Traditional inspection techniques require significant manual effort and expert interpretation. PV-LLM automates this by using **multimodal LLMs** to analyze different types of PV images:

* **Visibleimages** (birddropping)
* **Infrared (IR) images** (thermal anomalies, like hotspot)
* **Electroluminescence (EL) images** (microcracks, broken cells)

The system can:

* Classify fault types
* Localize issues
* Describe fault severity in natural language

## 2. Literature Mining: Global PV Degradation Insights

PV-LLM also performs large-scale **literature analysis** using LLMs. The system can:

* Read scientific papers
* Identify and extract degradation rates, technologies, and climates
* Compile global trends in PV degradation

This enables the creation of a unified degradation knowledge base across:

* Regions (e.g., US, EU, Asia)
* Technologies (e.g., mono, poly, thin-film)
* Timescales
